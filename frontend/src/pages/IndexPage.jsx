          <h2 className="text-3xl font-semibold">Why LexiMax?</h2>
          <p className="text-base">
            I decided to make LexiMax when I was trying to learn French. Immediately, I realized that there is just so much vocabulary and conjugations to memorize. 
            And personally, I was too lazy to go through rigorous memorization and spend hours at the textbook. So, I decided to create a fun game based interface
            to make learning more fun. Initially, I only intended this to be a French-learning website, but I quickly realized the same idea for a vocabulary game 
            can be applied to other languages as well (though the conjugation game is certainly more relatable to certain languages more than others).
            
            The basic premise here comes that you can add any things you want to memorize and then play games to test your knowledge. There are two main game styles:
            graded, where you have to submit your answer and will then be graded on whether it was correct or not; ungraded, where you have to answer the question
            as fast as possible and will be automatically moved on once you type the correct option. You have a lot of control about the type of game you want to play, 
            the words you include, whether you want to have articles for the words, and more. Hope you enjoy!
